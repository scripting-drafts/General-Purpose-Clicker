# General purpose clicker ;)
Get the range of coordinates of what has to be clicked. i.e. Use MouseTools on OS X or the get-coordinates.ps1 on Windows (included in this repo). Then specify them manually as x and y.

The default range of time between clicks is the z value when the current click number isn't any of the specified ones in the if's.

Change the total number of clicks by changing the times_to_repeat value.
